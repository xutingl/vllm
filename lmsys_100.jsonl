Notice that sqrt(18) = sqrt(2*9) = sqrt(2)sqrt(9) = 3sqrt(2), so sqrt(18) can be expressed in terms of sqrt(2), which means that including sqrt(18) in the field doesn't actually increase the degree of the extension.\nThus, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is the same as the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\nFor the degree of a simple extension field Q(a, b) over Q, we want to find the least common multiple (lcm) of the degrees of the extension fields Q(a) over Q and Q(b) over Q.\nsqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both irrational numbers, and the minimal polynomials that they are roots of are both quadratic (x^2 - 2 and x^2 - 3, respectively). Thus, the extension fields Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)) are both of degree 2 over Q.\nTherefore, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) has degree lcm(2, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4 over Q. The square root of 18 does not increase the degree of the field, as explained above.\nSo, the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) also has degree 4 over Q.\nAnswer key: \"B\"<end>\n\n<start>Question: NAME_1 is five years older than NAME_2, who is twice NAME_3's age at seven.

{"text": "\"You are an assistant who answers the question only based on given knowledge as truthfully as possible. I want you to Answer the question based on the given Knowledge.\n\nKnowledge:\nKopi luwak, also known as civet coffee, is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). The cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet's intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.[1] Asian palm civets are increasingly caught in the wild and traded for this purpose.\n\nKopi luwak is produced mainly on the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Sulawesi, and in East Timor. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in farms in the islands of the Philippines,[3] where the product is called kape motit in the Cordillera region, kap\u00e9 alam\u00edd in Tagalog areas, kap\u00e9 mel\u00f4 or kap\u00e9 musang in Mindanao, and kahawa kubing in the Sulu Archipelago. 'NAME_1 coffee' is a loose English translation of its Vietnamese name c\u00e0 ph\u00ea Ch\u1ed3n.\n\nProducers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms: selection, where civets choose to eat only certain cherries; and digestion, where biological or chemical mechanisms in the animals' digestive tracts alter the composition of the coffee cherries.\n\nThe traditional method of collecting feces from wild Asian palm civets has given way to an intensive farming method, in which the palm civets are kept in battery cages and are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets and the conditions they are made to live in, which include isolation, poor diet, small cages, and a high mortality rate.\n\nAlthough kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching US$100 per kilogram for farmed beans and US$1,300 per kilogram for wild-collected beans.[7] Another epithet given to it is that it is NAME_2 of coffees.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the cost of Kopi Luwak per kilogram\n\nAnswer:\"\n"}
